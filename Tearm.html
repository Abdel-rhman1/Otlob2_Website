                                            Otlob allows its members who ratify the agreement to order from restaurants online.<br/><br/>Otlob provides a way for you to communicate your orders to delivery restaurants displayed on this website.<br/><br/>The purpose of this site is to provide a simple and convenient service to consumers, linking them to restaurants in their area that offer takeaway food. Interactive menus allow customers to build and submit orders at the click of a button.<br/><br/>We have created the website to serve as a food court online market. Otlob is a commercial service for food delivery online.<br/><br/>Otlob does not sell or interfere in any way in the production of any food produced at the restaurants. But what this online market offers to the users is only providing the ability to search for and find local restaurants that deliver or make food available to their addresses and enables ordering this food through this website. The restaurants are obligated to comply with country local laws, rules, regulations, and standards pertaining to food preparation, sale, marketing and safety.<br/><br/>However, it is important for users to understand that Otlob does not in any way independently verify the credentials, representations or products of restaurants, the ingredients or the quality of any products, or that a restaurant is in compliance with applicable laws. Buyers must make themselves comfortable through information provided by restaurants on the website or as requested by buyers directly from the restaurants as to the quality and reliability of the restaurants, as well as to their compliance with applicable laws.<br/><br/>Otlob does not in any way guaranty the quality of any food or that any food complies with applicable laws and does not guarantee matching the menu displayed on the site of what is actually provided to the users.<br/><br/>In addition, a restaurant may represent that food preparation is in accordance with special standards such as "organic," "macrobiotic" or allergen-specific standards such as "nut-free", "gluten-free", or "lactose-free". However, Otlob does not independently investigate or verify such representations.<br/><br/>Otlob shall not be liable or responsible for any food or services offered by restaurants that is unhealthy, is the cause of injury, that is otherwise unacceptable to buyers or that does not meet the expectation of buyers in any manner.<br/><br/>Buyers are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of delivery addresses, and Otlob shall have no liability or responsibility for any such erroneous addresses. All food preparation and deliveries are the sole responsibility of the restaurant accepting the order. Please be aware that the restaurant will do everything they can to meet the delivery time specified, however delivery times may be affected by factors beyond their control and therefore cannot be guaranteed. We will inform you if we become aware of an unexpected delay.<br/>

                                            Any member of Otlob has a “user name” and “password” which are determined by the member herself/himself. The "user name" is personal to the member and the same “user name” is not given to two different members. The “password” is only known by the user. The user can change the password at any time. It is solely under the responsibility of the user to select and protect the password. Otlob is not liable for any problems, which may arise from the use of password. Otlob informs the user about the promotions, which take place in the user’s area and from which the user may benefit, by emails. Otlob does not share the user information with the third party companies – the phone number may be shared with the restaurant which deals with take-out foods, in order to provide a faster and correct delivery. For the user to connect to the services, which require a membership of Otlob, the user must enter the user name and password. This process is called “login” to Otlob.<br/><br/>By using this site, you warrant that any personal information provided by you is true, accurate, current and complete in all respects and that you will notify us immediately of any changes to your personal information by updating your member profile on the site or by contacting us, you agree not to impersonate any other person or entity or to use a false name or a name that you are not authorized to use.<br/>You are not allowed to register multiple memberships for use by the same person. Violation of this clause may result in termination of your membership.<br/><br/>Members' passwords should be kept confidential at all times, and must not be shared or disclosed to anyone. You are responsible for all activities and orders that occur or are submitted through your membership.
